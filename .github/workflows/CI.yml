      # The Maven basic phases in order: Validate, Compile, Test, Package, Verify, Install, Deploy.
      # The verify command executes each default lifecycle phase in order (validate, compile, package, etc.), before executing verify.
      # In most cases the effect is the same as package. However, in case there are integration tests, these will be executed as well.
      # During the verify phase some additional checks can be done, e.g. if your code is written according to the predefined checkstyle rules.
      # If you want to run your integration tests and check it, use verify. If you only want to run unit tests, use test.
